# Titanic---Survival-Prediction
Analysis for the 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster' competition, hosted by Kaggle.com

In this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
